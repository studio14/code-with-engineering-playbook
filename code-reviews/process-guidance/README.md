# Process Guidance

## General Guidance

Code reviews should be part of the software engineering team process regardless of the development model. Furthermore, the team should learn to execute reviews in a timely manner. [Pull requests (PRs)](../pull-requests.md) left hanging can cause additional merge problems and go stale resulting in lost work. Qualified PRs are expected to reflect well-defined, concise tasks, and thus be compact in content. Reviewing a single task should then take relatively little time to complete.

To ensure that the code review process is healthy and meets the goals stated above, consider following these guidelines:

- In the daily standup meeting check tasks pending for review and make sure they have reviewers assigned.
- Junior teams and teams new to the process can consider creating separate tasks for reviews together with the tasks themselves.
- Utilize tools to streamline the review process - [Code review tools](../tools.md)
